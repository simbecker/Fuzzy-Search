This is a normal essay. It talks about the dangers of playing badminton without eye-protection.
Did you know that the shuttlecock, which is the official name of the ball in badminton, can reach speeds up to 493 km/h?
That specific speed is the current world record, set by Malaysia's Tan Boon Heong in 2013.
So be careful when you play badminton!
